"""Event-band (envelope) analysis: recover a repetition rate the dynamometer's own
structural resonance is amplifying but cannot itself directly measure.

Above roughly fn/5 (the dynamometer's valid quantitative bandwidth -- see the design spec and
frame_transform's module docstring), the sensor stops measuring cutting force honestly and
starts ringing at its own resonance instead. That ringing is still useful: if something in
the process (chip segmentation, an impact) is exciting that resonance at some rate, the
resonance's AMPLITUDE is modulated at that rate even though its own frequency is far above
what the sensor can resolve. Band-pass around the resonance, take the Hilbert envelope, and
the envelope's own spectrum recovers the modulation rate -- the standard AM-demodulation
trick, also how bearing-fault diagnostics recovers a fault's repetition rate from a carrier
frequency the sensor can measure even when the fault rate itself is out of direct reach.

Deliberately time-domain: this operates on the FULL-RATE raw signal, not the angular-resampled
data the rest of this package's pipeline works in. The frequency content this recovers lives
in Hz (a real, physical rate), which the angular domain's orders-per-revolution deliberately
discards.
