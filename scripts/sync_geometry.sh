# The isometric geometry engine (sample shape drawing) is vendored into three Directus
# extensions because each is built as an independent package:
#   d1-geometry-preview  (canonical source — edit this one)
#   d1-home              (guided sample creator)
#   d1-report            (printed report)
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/sync_geometry.sh           copy the canonical geometry.ts into the other two
#   bash scripts/sync_geometry.sh --check   fail if a copy has drifted, or a stylesheet that
#                                           renders the SVG lacks one of the drawing classes
#                                           (pre-commit + CI run this)
