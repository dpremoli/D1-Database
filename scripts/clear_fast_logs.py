"""Step 1 of the FAST rebuild: snapshot sheet-only QA fields, then clear the
sheet-sourced sintering operations so they can be rebuilt from the machine backends.

The 1,895 `source_system='fast_log'` sintering ops were scraped from the Excel QA
log sheets. The machine backends (FAST 250 export list, FAST 25 MDB) are authoritative
for run metadata but carry NONE of the sheet's QA-only fields — CoSHH ref, PTC top/bot,
mass, mould diameter, and the free-text comments/failures/alarms. We back those up here,
keyed by a stable match key, so scripts/apply_fast_qa_backup.py can re-attach them to the
rebuilt rows afterwards.

Match key (mirrors backfill_fast_times.py): (date, recipe, batch, round(temp,1),
round(force,1)). Stored verbatim so the re-apply step can try tiered fallbacks.

The backup is append-only: each run snapshots only operations not already in
fast_log_qa_backup (de-duplicated by operation_id) and never truncates it, so re-running
the script after the sheet rows are gone cannot destroy the saved CoSHH refs and notes.
A non-dry run deletes data (and cascades to traces), so it requires --yes.

Usage:
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://d1:$POSTGRES_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/d1_database \
        python scripts/clear_fast_logs.py [--dry-run | --yes]
