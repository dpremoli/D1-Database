.SYNOPSIS
    Nightly backup of the D1 production Postgres database on d1-server.

.DESCRIPTION
    Runs pg_dump inside the running Postgres container, copies the archive out
    to a host folder, verifies the copy byte-for-byte by size, and prunes
    archives older than the retention window.

    Two artifacts are produced per run:

      d1_database-<stamp>.dump  custom-format archive of the database itself,
                                restorable with pg_restore (supports selective
                                and parallel restore).
      globals-<stamp>.sql       roles and other cluster-level objects, which a
                                per-database dump does NOT contain. Without
                                this a restore onto a fresh cluster fails on
                                missing role grants.

    The dump is written to the container's /tmp first and copied out with
    `docker cp` rather than streamed to stdout: PowerShell applies text
    encoding to redirected output, which silently corrupts binary streams.

    Credentials are never passed on the command line or logged — the script
    reads POSTGRES_USER / POSTGRES_DB from the container's own environment.

    After the local backup succeeds, both artifacts are copied off-host to the
    university filestore. The local copy protects against a bad migration or a
    corrupted volume; only the off-host copy survives losing the machine.

.PARAMETER DestinationRoot
    Folder to write archives to. Defaults to D:\D1-Backups\postgres.

.PARAMETER RetentionDays
    Archives older than this are deleted after a successful run. Defaults to 14.
    Pruning is skipped entirely if the run fails, so a broken backup job never
    eats the last good archives.

.PARAMETER Container
    Name of the Postgres container. Defaults to d1-database-postgres-1.

.PARAMETER OffsiteRoot
    UNC path on the university filestore to copy each new pair of artifacts to.
    A UNC path rather than the Z: mapping on purpose: drive letters belong to a
    logon session and a scheduled task cannot be relied on to see them. Set to
    an empty string to skip the off-host step.

.PARAMETER OffsiteRetentionDays
    Off-host archives older than this are deleted after a verified copy.
    Defaults to 5 — shorter than the local window because the share is a quota'd
    group area also holding ~26 GB of Directus uploads.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -File scripts\backup-postgres.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    # Local only, e.g. when off the university network
    pwsh -File scripts\backup-postgres.ps1 -OffsiteRoot ''

.NOTES
    Exit codes: 0 success; 1 the local backup failed (nothing new was written);
    2 the local backup succeeded but the off-host copy did not — the share was
    unreachable, out of quota, or the copy did not verify. Code 2 means you still
    have a good local backup but no off-host one, so it needs attention rather
    than alarm.

    Verify restorability periodically — a dump that has never been restored is
    not a backup. See docs/adr/0010 step 0. To test:

      docker exec <container> sh -c 'psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d postgres \
        -c "CREATE DATABASE restore_test"'
      docker cp <archive> <container>:/tmp/t.dump
      docker exec <container> sh -c 'pg_restore -U "$POSTGRES_USER" \
        -d restore_test -j 2 /tmp/t.dump'

    then compare row counts against production and drop restore_test.
