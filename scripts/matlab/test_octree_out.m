function test_octree_out()
% Regression test for the octree_out + live_cache.bin combination the Diagnostics Workbench's
% diag handler (process_diag_row, scripts/force_orchestrator.py) needs from a SINGLE
% process_force call: the raw-spiral octree emit (cloud.bin) AND the dense live cache
% (live_cache.bin), together. octree_out used to `return` right after writing cloud.bin,
% which meant run_analysis never reached its own `summary = struct(...)` assignment when
% octree_out was set -- calling code that also expected live_cache.bin got neither the file
% nor a clean error, just MATLAB's own generic "unassignedOutputs" error and a status='error'
% summary.json with that unhelpful message, not the real cause.

% ---- step > 1: the decimated case the step=1 assertion above cannot reach ----------------
% The original version of this test only ever ran the block above, with live_cache_points at
% 5,000,000 against a 60,000-sample fixture -- so `step` was always 1 and `octN == cacheN` was
% vacuously true. That is why this file did not catch the real defect: for a cut window LARGER
% than live_cache_points, write_live_cache strides (step = ceil(N0/target)) while the octree
% emit does not, so the two files legitimately differ in length and process_diag_row must
% decimate the cloud to match rather than treat it as fatal.
%
% Forcing a small live_cache_points on the SAME fixture is what makes this cheap: no large
% synthetic is needed to exercise the strided path, only a target below the window length.

% unstrided run's cache sampled at 1:step:end, on the same fixture. Combined with the step=1
