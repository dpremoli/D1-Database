"""One-off smoke test: process exactly the diag_status='pending' rows via handle_diags, and
nothing else in the orchestrator's queue. Deliberately bypasses run_queue/--run/--discover,
which would also process the 74 pending base analyses and 4 pending octrees already queued.

Usage (from the repo root, with POTREE_CONVERTER set in the environment):
    py scripts/diag_smoke_check.py

Named *_check.py, not *_test.py: it is a manual developer utility, not part of the pytest
suite, and must not be collected by a bare `pytest` run (it imports force_orchestrator and
psycopg2 at module scope).
