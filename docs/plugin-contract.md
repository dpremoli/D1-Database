# Plugin Contract — Core ↔ Plugin Interface

**Version:** Phase 4
**Status:** Active
**Last updated:** 2026-06-18

---

## 1. Overview

This document specifies the interface that any heavy-data plugin must honour in
order to interoperate with the D1-Database LIMS core. It is written in
Directus-agnostic terms (plain HTTP and JSON) so that the contract survives an
adapter swap (see ADR-0002).

A "plugin" in this sense is a worker container that:

- Accepts presigned-upload requests from clients.
- Receives webhook notifications from the core when a new `test_sessions` record
  is created with a `file_storage_pointer`.
- Processes the referenced file asynchronously via a Redis job queue.
- Writes results back to the core via the standard REST API.

The reference implementation is `plugins/heavy-data-worker/`. A conforming
replacement may be written in any language provided it satisfies every endpoint
and behaviour defined here.

---

## 2. Authentication

### 2.1 Plugin-to-core authentication

The plugin authenticates all write-back requests to the core API using a static
Operator machine token. This is the same token pattern used by equipment nodes
(see `docs/api-contract.md` §2.2 and ADR-0005).

The token is supplied as an environment variable:

```
WORKER_DIRECTUS_TOKEN=<static-bearer-token>
```

All requests from the plugin to the core include:

```
Authorization: Bearer <WORKER_DIRECTUS_TOKEN>
```

The associated machine user must hold the Operator role in the core's RBAC
structure. It must have `PATCH` permission on the `test_sessions` collection.

### 2.2 Actor identity header

The plugin should set the actor identity header on all mutating requests so
that the audit log records an identifiable actor:

```
X-Actor-Identity: heavy-data-worker
```

### 2.3 Webhook authentication

The Directus Flow POSTs to the plugin's webhook endpoint. The endpoint is
reachable only within the Docker network (`http://heavy-data-worker:8080`) and
is not exposed to the public internet. No additional token is required on the
webhook path; network isolation is the control.

If the deployment topology changes (e.g., the worker is exposed externally),
a shared secret header (`X-D1-Webhook-Secret`) should be added to the Flow
configuration and validated by the handler.

---

## 3. Queue Message Shape

When the webhook fires, the handler enqueues a job on the Redis queue using the
`rq` library. The queue is named `heavy-data`.

The job is enqueued by calling the worker function with the following keyword
arguments (serialised by rq as JSON):

```json
{
  "session_id": "<uuid of the test_sessions record>",
  "object_key": "<MinIO object key, e.g. 10-AA-MF-2024-03-15/F1/10-AA-MF-2024-03-15-F1.d1f>",
  "collection": "test_sessions"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `session_id` | string (UUID) | Primary key of the `test_sessions` record to update on completion. |
| `object_key` | string | MinIO object key extracted from `file_storage_pointer` (everything after `minio://{bucket}/`). |
| `collection` | string | Always `test_sessions` in Phase 4. Reserved for future multi-collection support. |

The `object_key` is derived from the `file_storage_pointer` field of the
`test_sessions` record. See §7 for the storage pointer convention.

---

## 4. Presigned Upload API

The plugin exposes two endpoints to support direct-to-MinIO multipart upload.
These are called by the client before the file reaches MinIO; the plugin never
touches the file contents at this stage.

### 4.1 Initiate multipart upload

```
POST /api/presign-upload
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <WORKER_DIRECTUS_TOKEN>
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "object_key": "10-AA-MF-2024-03-15/F1/10-AA-MF-2024-03-15-F1.d1f",
  "n_parts": 12,
  "content_type": "application/octet-stream"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `object_key` | string | yes | Destination key in the configured MinIO bucket. Must follow the naming convention in §7. |
| `n_parts` | integer | yes | Number of parts. Each part except the last must be at least 5 MB. |
| `content_type` | string | no | MIME type. Defaults to `application/octet-stream`. |

Response (`200 OK`):

```json
{
  "upload_id": "VXBsb2FkIElE...",
  "presigned_urls": [
    {
      "part_number": 1,
      "url": "http://minio:9000/d1-data/10-AA-MF-2024-03-15/F1/10-AA-MF-2024-03-15-F1.d1f?partNumber=1&uploadId=VXBsb2FkIElE...&X-Amz-Signature=..."
    },
    {
      "part_number": 2,
      "url": "http://minio:9000/d1-data/..."
    }
  ],
  "expires_at": "2026-06-18T14:00:00Z"
}
```

The client PUTs each part to the corresponding `url`. The server returns an
`ETag` header in each part response; the client must collect these for the
complete-upload call.

### 4.2 Complete multipart upload

```
POST /api/complete-upload
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <WORKER_DIRECTUS_TOKEN>
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "object_key": "10-AA-MF-2024-03-15/F1/10-AA-MF-2024-03-15-F1.d1f",
  "upload_id": "VXBsb2FkIElE...",
  "parts": [
    { "part_number": 1, "etag": "\"d8e8fca2dc0f896fd7cb4cb0031ba249\"" },
    { "part_number": 2, "etag": "\"58e53d1324eef6265fdb97b08ed9aadf\"" }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `object_key` | string | yes | Must match the key used in presign-upload. |
| `upload_id` | string | yes | The `upload_id` returned by presign-upload. |
| `parts` | array | yes | Ordered list of `{part_number, etag}` objects. ETags are the values returned by MinIO in the `ETag` response header for each part PUT. |

Response (`200 OK`):

```json
{
  "object_key": "10-AA-MF-2024-03-15/F1/10-AA-MF-2024-03-15-F1.d1f",
  "size_bytes": 12884901888,
  "etag": "\"abc123-12\""
}
```

On error the plugin returns a standard JSON error body:

```json
{
  "error": "UPLOAD_ASSEMBLY_FAILED",
  "message": "MinIO returned 400 for CompleteMultipartUpload: EntityTooSmall"
}
```

---

## 5. Webhook Endpoint

The Directus Flow calls this endpoint on every `test_sessions` item creation.

```
POST /api/webhook/session
Content-Type: application/json
```

Request body (Directus webhook payload shape):

```json
{
  "event": "items.create",
  "collection": "test_sessions",
  "key": "<session_id>",
  "payload": {
    "file_storage_pointer": "minio://d1-data/10-AA-MF-2024-03-15/F1/10-AA-MF-2024-03-15-F1.d1f",
    "status": "pending_processing",
    "sample_id": "<uuid>",
    "session_date": "2026-06-18T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

The plugin uses `key` as `session_id` and parses `payload.file_storage_pointer`
to derive the `object_key` (see §7).

**The webhook handler must return HTTP 202 immediately**, before any processing
begins. All processing happens asynchronously via the queue (§3). A synchronous
response ensures the Directus Flow does not time out on large files.

```
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json

{ "queued": true, "session_id": "<session_id>" }
```

If the `file_storage_pointer` is absent or does not begin with `minio://`, the
handler logs a warning and returns 200 without enqueuing (the session does not
have a heavy-data file to process).

---

## 6. Write-Back API

On completion (or failure) the worker PATCHes the `test_sessions` record via
the core REST API.

```
PATCH /items/test_sessions/{session_id}
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <WORKER_DIRECTUS_TOKEN>
X-Actor-Identity: heavy-data-worker
```

### 6.1 Success write-back

```json
{
  "status": "processed",
  "summary_stats": {
    "n_samples": 40000000,
    "sample_rate_hz": 20000,
    "duration_s": 2000.0,
    "channels": {
      "Fx": { "mean_N": 120.4, "std_N": 8.2, "min_N": 89.1, "max_N": 154.7 },
      "Fy": { "mean_N": -3.1, "std_N": 1.4, "min_N": -7.2, "max_N": 0.8 },
      "Fz": { "mean_N": 950.2, "std_N": 22.6, "min_N": 880.0, "max_N": 1020.3 },
      "Mx": { "mean_Nm": 0.12, "std_Nm": 0.04, "min_Nm": 0.01, "max_Nm": 0.28 },
      "My": { "mean_Nm": -0.08, "std_Nm": 0.03, "min_Nm": -0.19, "max_Nm": 0.02 },
      "Mz": { "mean_Nm": 0.33, "std_Nm": 0.09, "min_Nm": 0.11, "max_Nm": 0.61 }
    }
  },
  "plot_uris": [
    "minio://d1-data/plots/10-AA-MF-2024-03-15/F1/10-AA-MF-2024-03-15-F1-forces.svg"
  ]
}
```

### 6.2 Error write-back

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "summary_stats": {
    "error": "D1F_HEADER_INVALID",
    "message": "Magic bytes mismatch: expected 44314f524345 got 504b0304"
  },
  "plot_uris": []
}
```

### 6.3 Status lifecycle

```
pending_processing  →  processing  →  processed
                                   ↘  error
```

| Status | Set by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `pending_processing` | Client (on session create) | File uploaded; worker not yet started. |
| `processing` | Worker (on job start) | Worker has dequeued the job and begun reading the file. |
| `processed` | Worker (on success) | Statistics and plot URI written; session is complete. |
| `error` | Worker (on failure) | Processing failed; `summary_stats` contains error detail. |

The worker sets `status = processing` as its first write-back, before streaming
the file. This provides a visible signal that the job has been picked up.

---

## 7. File Storage Pointer Convention

The `file_storage_pointer` field in `test_sessions` (and `manufacturing_operations`)
follows this URI scheme:

```
minio://{bucket}/{object_key}
```

The `object_key` for D1F force files must follow the D1 naming convention:

```
{sample_code}/{pass_code}/{filename}.d1f
```

Example:

```
minio://d1-data/10-AA-MF-2024-03-15/10-AA-MF-2024-03-15-F1/10-AA-MF-2024-03-15-F1-20MPM_0.05feed_0.1DoC.d1f
```

Plot URIs generated by the worker follow:

```
minio://d1-data/plots/{sample_code}/{pass_code}/{filename}-{channel}.svg
```

The plugin must parse the URI by stripping the `minio://{bucket}/` prefix to
obtain the raw object key. The bucket name is taken from the worker's environment
(`MINIO_BUCKET`, default `d1-data`); it must not be hard-coded.

---

## 8. Summary Stats JSON Schema

The `summary_stats` column is `JSONB`. On success the worker writes an object
conforming to the following structure:

```json
{
  "n_samples": "<integer — total sample count across all channels>",
  "sample_rate_hz": "<integer — from D1F header>",
  "duration_s": "<float — n_samples / sample_rate_hz>",
  "channels": {
    "<channel_name>": {
      "mean_<unit>": "<float>",
      "std_<unit>":  "<float>",
      "min_<unit>":  "<float>",
      "max_<unit>":  "<float>"
    }
  }
}
```

Channel names and units:

| Channel | Unit suffix |
|---|---|
| `Fx` | `_N` |
| `Fy` | `_N` |
| `Fz` | `_N` |
| `Mx` | `_Nm` |
| `My` | `_Nm` |
| `Mz` | `_Nm` |

All statistical values are computed in streaming chunks; the worker must not
load the full float32 array into memory. Chunk size is determined by
`WORKER_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` (see `docs/runbooks/heavy-data-pipeline.md` §8).

On error the `summary_stats` object contains at minimum:

```json
{
  "error": "<machine-readable code>",
  "message": "<human-readable explanation>"
}
```

---

## 9. Error Handling

- **The worker must PATCH `status = error`** if any stage of processing fails
  (header parse error, MinIO read error, arithmetic exception, etc.). Leaving
  the session in `processing` with no write-back is not acceptable; it leaves
  the record in an indeterminate state with no recovery path.
- **The webhook must return 202 before any processing.** Synchronous processing
  inside the webhook handler is forbidden. If the Redis queue is unavailable the
  handler should return 503 with a descriptive body; the Directus Flow will retry
  according to its configured retry policy.
- **Partial uploads.** If the client aborts after `presign-upload` but before
  `complete-upload`, the multipart upload remains open in MinIO. The worker
  should not encounter this (no session is registered), but operators should run
  `make cleanup-minio-multipart` periodically to abort stale multipart uploads
  (MinIO lifecycle policy is the preferred long-term solution).
- **Missing file.** If the worker cannot find the object in MinIO (404), it must
  PATCH `status = error` with `error = OBJECT_NOT_FOUND`. It must not retry
  indefinitely.

---

## 10. Adding a New Plugin

To register a new plugin against the D1-Database core:

1. **Provision a machine user.** Create a Directus user with the Operator role
   and a static token. Follow `docs/api-contract.md` §13.3. Use the email
   convention `<plugin-name>@d1-internal.local`.

2. **Set the environment variable.** Add `WORKER_DIRECTUS_TOKEN=<token>` to the
   plugin container's environment (via `.env` or Docker Compose `environment:`
   block). Never commit the token to source control.

3. **Configure the Directus Flow.** In Directus: Flows → Create Flow →
   Trigger: Event Hook → Collection: `test_sessions` → Action: Create →
   Operation: Webhook/Request → URL:
   `http://<plugin-container-name>:8080/api/webhook/session` → Method: POST →
   Body: Include Payload. See `docs/runbooks/heavy-data-pipeline.md` §3 for the
   step-by-step walkthrough.

4. **Expose a `/health` endpoint.** The plugin must respond to
   `GET /health` with HTTP 200 and `{ "status": "ok" }`. This is used by
   Docker Compose readiness checks and monitoring tooling.

5. **Implement all endpoints in §4 and §5.** The core does not care about
   implementation language; it cares about the HTTP contract.

6. **Validate write-back.** After deployment, create a test session with a known
   `.d1f` file and confirm that `status` transitions to `processed` and
   `summary_stats` is populated. Use `make phase4-test` for the integration
   harness.
