# Feature designs

`specs/` holds the design document behind each substantial feature: the problem, the options
weighed and the decision taken. Each opens with a **Status** line saying whether it has shipped
and where the implementation lives. Specs stay after a feature ships, because code, migrations and
config cite them for their rationale.

Implementation plans — step-by-step task lists written for agentic execution — live in `plans/`
only while the work is in flight. Once the feature has shipped and been verified against the code,
its plan is deleted and the git history is the record. The folder does not exist when no plan is
open.

Add a row when a new spec lands, and update its Status line (and this table) when it ships.
