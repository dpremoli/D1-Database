# ADR-0010 — Force-App: Shared Plotting Package, Repo Extraction, Electron Packaging

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-08-09 (revised same day — see *Revision note*)
- **Deciders:** Maintainer + Claude (architecture discussion)

## Revision note

The first draft of this ADR framed the problem as **database reachability**: that
force-app development was blocked because Directus and Postgres live on
`d1-server` while development happens elsewhere. That framing was wrong and has
been removed. The equipment-connected development machine is on the same
tailnet as `d1-server` and already reaches Directus over it — `apps/force-app`
defaults `DIRECTUS_URL` to `https://d1-server.tail54eeb6.ts.net` and has been
working that way.

Correcting the premise changed three things:

- The **local disposable Directus + Postgres stack** dropped out of the critical
  path. Its only remaining justification is isolation for risky schema changes,
  which is better served — far more cheaply — by an actual database backup.
- The **repo split** kept its justification, but a different one: likely
  handover to another student or lab, plus an independent release cadence for
  desktop updates. Not reachability.
- The **dashboard duplication** turned out to be a 45-line divergence, not a
  genuine fork, which makes a shared package the obvious resolution and makes
  the split cheaper once it is done.

## Context

`apps/force-app/` (backend, web, backup-server) is a Windows-only,
hardware-tied recording and plotting client — NI-DAQ acquisition, LabAmp
control — built against the same Directus instance as the core LIMS, but
living inside the D1-Database monorepo alongside a very different stack
(Postgres/Redis/Minio/Directus/Ollama via `docker-compose.yml`).

**The two-machine constraint is permanent, and it is not a networking
problem.** The DAQ and LabAmp are physically wired to a development machine
that is not `d1-server` and will not become `d1-server`. Both machines are on
the same tailnet, so the database is reachable; what cannot be collapsed is the
hardware. Any plan that assumes force-app development can happen "next to the
database" is assuming something false. Development happens on the
equipment-connected machine, against Directus over Tailscale.

Three real drivers remain:

1. **Ownership is likely to diverge.** force-app may be handed to another
   student or another lab. GitHub cannot grant repository access to a
   subdirectory, so a shared boundary eventually becomes an access-control
   problem.
2. **Release cadence must diverge.** Field-deployed recording PCs need updates
   without manual `git pull`s, on a schedule unrelated to the LIMS server's.
   force-app has no CI wiring today — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` contains no
   reference to it.
3. **The plotting code has already drifted.** A near-identical
   `ForceDashboard.vue` exists in `core/extensions/d1-force-dashboard/` (a
   Directus module, bind-mounted live into the running container) and
   `apps/force-app/web/src/force/` (the standalone app).

On (3), the divergence was measured rather than assumed. `ForceDashboard.vue`
is 2039 lines in the extension and 2060 in the standalone app, and `diff`
reports only **45 changed lines**. They reduce to three environment concerns:

| Concern | Directus extension | Standalone app |
|---|---|---|
| Opening a record | `router.push('/content/…')` | `window.open(directusUrl + '/admin/content/…')` |
| Downloading an asset | cookie-authed `<a href="/assets/…">` | Bearer-authed fetch → blob |
| Layout density | roomier padding | tighter padding |

Plus one substantive difference: a **bug fix present only in the standalone
copy** (the operations list failing to self-filter on a deep link, with a
`scrollIntoView` for off-screen rows). The drift is running in the direction
that is hardest to notice — the Directus surface is the stale one. The same
pattern holds for `FrmCloud.vue` (674 vs 690), `ForceChart.vue` (392 vs 392),
`FrmOctree.vue` (372 vs 375) and five further shared files: roughly 4,000
duplicated lines in total.

Two further facts about the current deployment shape:

- **The standalone app is already served from `d1-server`.**
  `infra/caddy/Caddyfile` has a `handle_path /app/*` block serving
  `/srv/force-app` same-origin with Directus, reachable over Tailscale at
  `https://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net/app/`.
- **The `/recorder/*` proxy points at the wrong machine for recording.** Caddy
  forwards it to `host.docker.internal:8200`, i.e. `d1-server`'s own host, but
  the recorder runs on the equipment machine. The browser surface can therefore
  plot history correctly but cannot drive a recording. This is not worth fixing
  in Caddy: Electron resolves it by construction, since a bundled sidecar is on
  `localhost:8200` by definition. It does draw a clean line — **`/app/` is the
  read-only historical viewing surface; Electron is the recording surface.**

Finally, an unrelated gap surfaced while assessing how safe it is to develop
against the live database: **there is no backup of production Postgres.** No
`pg_dump` service in `docker-compose.yml`, no scheduled task on the
`d1-server` host, only a named `pgdata` volume. A corrupted or deleted volume
loses the research database outright. (The `backup` code under
`apps/force-app/` is the live *capture* backup server — unrelated to database
backups.)

## Decision

Agreed for planning purposes; not yet executed. The sequence below is ordered
so that the irreversible step comes last and each step makes the next cheaper.

### 0. Back up the production database (prerequisite) — **DONE 2026-08-09**

This is a prerequisite, not a nicety. It is what makes "develop against the
live Directus over Tailscale" a defensible position rather than a gamble, and
it delivers the safety the first draft of this ADR wanted a whole local stack
for, at a fraction of the cost.

Implemented as `scripts/backup-postgres.ps1`, run nightly at 02:00 by the
Windows scheduled task **"D1 Postgres Nightly Backup"** on `d1-server`:

- `pg_dump -Fc` of `d1_database` plus `pg_dumpall --globals-only` for cluster
  roles — a per-database dump does not contain role definitions, so without
  the latter a restore onto a fresh cluster fails on missing grants.
- Written to `D:\D1-Backups\postgres` (6 TB free), 14-day retention, ~1.31 GB
  per archive (2710 MB database). Pruning runs only after a fully successful
  backup, so a broken job cannot delete the last good archives.
- The dump is written inside the container and copied out with `docker cp`,
  not streamed to stdout: PowerShell applies text encoding to redirected
  output and silently corrupts binary streams.
- The task runs as an interactive user rather than SYSTEM, because Docker
  Desktop's named pipe is not reachable from the SYSTEM account — that
  configuration produces a task that appears healthy and fails every night.

**Restore verified, not assumed.** The archive was restored into a scratch
database (`pg_restore -j 2`, exit 0, zero errors) and row counts compared
against production across eight tables — `physical_samples` 143,
`manufacturing_operations` 10,283, `machining_force_analysis` 189,
`fast_run_data` 10,040, `directus_files` 233,738, `directus_revisions` 23,519,
`audit_logs` 129,724, `directus_users` 15 — all matching exactly. The scratch
database was then dropped. A scheduled run was also triggered manually and
completed with `LastTaskResult: 0`.

Re-verify restorability periodically; the procedure is documented in the
script's header comment.

### 1. Extract plotting into a shared workspace package — **DONE 2026-08-10**

Live in production. `core/extensions/d1-force-dashboard/src/` went from 11 files
to 2, `apps/force-app/web/src/force/` from 14 to 2 — roughly 4,240 duplicated lines
removed.

**The Directus surface gained five things it never had**, all previously
standalone-only: `buildSeriesEnvelope()`, the `liveCloud` empty-array guards and NaN
clamp (the FRM map rendering solid white), the two `FrmCloud` `renderer.clear()`
white-flash fixes, and the deep-link operations-list filter.

Three things learned in execution that the plan had wrong, recorded because each
would mislead the next person:

- **`EXTENSIONS_AUTO_RELOAD: "true"` does not fire across a Windows→Linux Docker
  bind mount.** Rebuilding `dist/index.js` is *not* sufficient — Directus kept
  serving the in-memory bundle it had loaded days earlier, and a full browser
  test suite passed 11/11 against the stale code. Only an A/B on behaviour unique
  to the new bundle caught it. **`docker restart d1-database-directus-1` is
  required after any extension rebuild on this host.**
- **The extension bundle is not tracked in git** — `.gitignore` excludes `dist/`.
  It is a build artifact regenerated on the host, so there is nothing to commit at
  cutover.
- **The `/app/` browser surface needs redeploying too.** `docker-compose.yml`
  bind-mounts `./apps/force-app/web/dist` into Caddy as `/srv/force-app`, so any
  change to `apps/force-app/web` requires `npm run build:web` to reach users.
  Unlike Directus this needs no restart — Caddy's `file_server` reads from disk per
  request and `index.html` is served `no-cache`.

Both surfaces were verified in a real browser after cutover: the Directus module
narrows a deep-linked operations list from 108 rows to 3 (the fix it previously
lacked), and `/app/` renders the dashboard with its sample list populated.

The original decision text follows.

Create `packages/force-plotting` as an npm workspace holding the single copy of
`ForceDashboard.vue`, `FrmCloud.vue`, `ForceChart.vue`, `FrmOctree.vue`,
`SpectrumView.vue`, `filterChain.ts`, `frmExport.ts`, `liveCache.ts`,
`liveCloud.ts` and `signalStats.ts`.

The three environment concerns become an injected host adapter:

```ts
interface ForceHost {
  api: AxiosInstance                               // Directus SDK vs standalone Bearer client
  openRecord(collection: string, id: string): void // router.push vs window.open
  downloadAsset(fileId: string): Promise<void>     // cookie <a> vs Bearer blob
  dense?: boolean                                  // layout density
}
```

`core/extensions/d1-force-dashboard` keeps its existing 12-line `defineModule`
registration and gains a Directus adapter. `apps/force-app/web` mounts the same
components with its standalone adapter. One implementation, two surfaces, the
duplication gone and the standalone-only bug fix reaching Directus in the
process.

This is the boundary work, and it is a prerequisite for a clean split: a clean
boundary is what makes extraction mechanical, and extracting before the
boundary is clean just distributes the drift across two repositories where it
is harder to see.

### 2. Extract `apps/force-app` into its own repository

`packages/force-plotting` **and** the thin Directus module wrapper both move
into the force-app repository, because that is where plotting expertise lives.
Three paths therefore have to travel together — `apps/force-app`,
`packages/force-plotting` and `core/extensions/d1-force-dashboard`. That rules
out `git subtree split`, which takes a single prefix; use `git filter-repo`
with one `--path` per directory to preserve history across all three:

```
git filter-repo --path apps/force-app \
                --path packages/force-plotting \
                --path core/extensions/d1-force-dashboard
```

Run it against a fresh clone — `filter-repo` rewrites history in place and
refuses to run on a repository with existing remotes by default.

force-app then builds two artifacts from one codebase: the Electron installer,
and a versioned `directus-extension-d1-force-dashboard` bundle. D1-Database
consumes the latter as a pinned dependency.

This is the point of the inversion: improvements to plotting are not *ported*
into Directus, they are **published**, and D1-Database bumps a version.
Porting is what drifts; a versioned dependency does not. It also lets the
Directus surface deliberately lag a release during an experiment rather than
lagging by accident.

### 3. Package the recorder backend as a PyInstaller sidecar

Freeze the existing Python backend into a binary spawned, health-checked and
restarted by Electron's main process, replacing the current Windows Scheduled
Task. The backend is already Windows-only (`nidaqmx`, direct LabAmp protocol
handling), so this is a packaging change, not a platform change. No Docker on
client machines.

### 4. Ship updates via `electron-builder`'s `autoUpdater`

Feed hosted either as static files behind the Caddy proxy already running on
`d1-server`, or via private GitHub Releases.

**Sequencing:** (0) and (1) are independent of everything else, safe, and
reversible — do them first, in that order. (2) is the irreversible step and
should be executed deliberately once (1) has settled. (3)–(4) are a distinct
later phase. Do not attempt this in one pass.

## Alternatives considered

### (a) Stand up a local disposable Directus + Postgres dev stack first

The first draft made this step 1, on the grounds that the database was
unreachable from the development machine.

Demoted, because the premise was false — see *Revision note*. The database is
reachable over Tailscale and force-app already uses it that way. The residual
argument is isolation for schema experiments, and for that a verified backup
(step 0) buys more safety per unit of effort than a second full stack to
install and maintain on an acquisition machine. A local throwaway stack remains
a reasonable *tool* to reach for when a specific change is destructive or
uncertain; it is not a prerequisite for day-to-day work.

### (b) Retire `core/extensions/d1-force-dashboard` entirely

Since `/app/` is already served same-origin from `d1-server`, the standalone
app could simply replace the in-admin dashboard.

Rejected: in-admin plotting is a genuinely useful surface for LIMS users who
are not running the desktop app, and sending them to a separate URL loses the
record context they are already sitting in. With the divergence measured at 45
lines, deleting a working surface to avoid duplication is the wrong trade —
sharing the code removes the duplication without removing the feature.

### (c) Embed `/app/` in the Directus module via an iframe

A ~50-line Directus module could iframe the already-deployed `/app/` build,
giving automatic freshness with no shared package.

Rejected: it would work, but it trades a solved problem for several unsolved
ones — nested navigation and scroll chrome, theme inheritance, passing record
context across the frame boundary, and CSP `frame-src` configuration. The
adapter approach in step 1 achieves the same single-source-of-truth outcome
with better integration, given how small the actual divergence is. Worth
reconsidering only if the adapter interface starts accumulating environment
concerns well beyond the current three.

### (d) Partial extraction via git subtree/submodule as an ongoing sync mechanism

Use a subtree or submodule to give force-app semi-independent versioning
without a full split.

Ruled out: adds subtree-merge / submodule-pin tooling to every change without
delivering the independent access control that motivates the split. Note this
is distinct from a *one-time* history-preserving extraction (`git filter-repo`,
step 2), which is a single operation rather than an ongoing obligation.

### (e) Split the repository immediately, before the shared package

Extract now and resolve the duplication afterwards.

Ruled out: the duplication is the boundary violation. Splitting first preserves
it under two repositories instead of one, and converts a local refactor into a
cross-repository publishing exercise. Deferring the split costs nothing — a
history-preserving extraction remains available at any time.

### (f) Tauri instead of Electron

Considered 2026-08-10, after this ADR was first written. Tauri v2 borrows the system
WebView2 rather than shipping Chromium, has a built-in signed updater, and Rust is
not foreign here.

Not adopted. A PyInstaller bundle carrying numpy, scipy and nidaqmx is 150–250 MB
whichever shell is used, so the realistic comparison is ~350 MB against ~220 MB —
the Python payload dominates and Tauri's size advantage is diluted. Against that,
the UI is unusually WebGL-heavy (Potree octrees plus hand-written WebGL FRM
rendering), and Electron ships its own Chromium so every rig renders identically;
Tauri inherits whatever WebView2 version a machine happens to have, which is a
support cost on machines the maintainer does not administer. Electron also avoids
adding a Rust toolchain to an otherwise Node/Vite pipeline — `abetterplus-rust` is a
PyO3 extension crate and would not be reused by a Tauri shell.

### (g) Package the desktop app only after the repo split

This ADR originally sequenced extraction (step 2) before packaging (steps 3–4).

Reversed 2026-08-10. `apps/force-app/desktop/` plus a path-filtered release workflow
gives independent versioning and releases from inside the monorepo, and step 1
already made force-app cleanly separable, so extraction stays cheap. Performing the
irreversible step before knowing what packaging actually needs is the wrong order.

### (h) Rewrite the recorder backend in Node/TypeScript

Avoids bundling a second language runtime inside the Electron app.

Ruled out: the backend's value is in already-working, tested hardware
integration. A rewrite is large, high-risk, and buys nothing that a
PyInstaller sidecar does not already achieve at far lower cost.

## Consequences

### Positive

- A verified database backup closes a gap that currently risks total loss of
  the research database, independent of anything force-app related.
- One plotting implementation instead of two. Roughly 4,000 duplicated lines
  removed, and the standalone-only bug fix propagates to the Directus surface.
- The in-admin Directus dashboard survives, and stays current by version bump
  rather than by remembering to copy files across.
- The repo split becomes mechanical rather than fraught, and stays optional
  until access control actually requires it.
- force-app becomes independently versioned and CI-able — a prerequisite for
  Electron auto-update to field machines.
- Electron resolves the `/recorder/*` proxy pointing at the wrong host, and
  clarifies the split of surfaces: `/app/` for historical viewing, Electron for
  recording.

### Negative / Costs

- The host-adapter interface is a new abstraction to maintain. If the two
  surfaces diverge much further than the current three concerns, it will need
  revisiting — see alternative (c).
- After the split, D1-Database gains a published dependency on an artifact
  built in another repository: a release step, a version bump, and a
  possible-lag failure mode that does not exist today.
- The schema remains a cross-repository contract after the split, requiring an
  explicit sync step that will not update itself.
- Sidecar lifecycle management, error surfacing to the Electron UI, and
  eventual code-signing are real engineering work, separate from and after the
  repo split.
- Splitting the repository is hard to fully reverse (history, issues, PR links)
  and should be executed deliberately.
- Developing against the live Directus instance remains the default. Step 0
  makes this recoverable, not risk-free; destructive schema changes still
  warrant a throwaway stack or a fresh dump taken immediately beforehand.

## Open decisions (not yet resolved)

- **Schema contract mechanism after the split.** force-app is an API *client*,
  not a migration runner, so copied DDL is the wrong shape. The leading
  candidate is TypeScript types generated from Directus's OpenAPI spec,
  committed to the force-app repo and regenerated on a deliberate cadence, with
  the existing Connectivity Doctor extended to report schema mismatches at
  runtime. Not yet decided.
- ~~Where the Electron auto-update feed is hosted.~~ **Resolved 2026-08-10:**
  static files behind the Caddy proxy on `d1-server`. The app must stay private
  — its existence and behaviour should not be publicly visible — which rules out
  public GitHub Releases; private Releases is worse, needing a leakable access
  token embedded in every shipped binary. In v1 all users are on the tailnet by
  definition, so a Caddy-served feed is private *by construction* rather than
  merely access-controlled.

  This is coupled to shipping unsigned: `electron-updater` skips signature
  verification on unsigned apps, so the update channel's trust rests entirely on
  the transport. Unsigned plus tailnet-only is coherent; unsigned plus public
  hosting would be a remote-code-execution path into the rigs. **If labs that
  are not on the tailnet ever need updates, signing and feed hosting must be
  revisited together.**

  See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-10-force-app-desktop-packaging-design.md`.
- CI setup for the force-app repo (none exists today), including how the
  Directus extension bundle is published and consumed.
- ~~**Off-host copy of the backups.**~~ **Resolved 2026-08-10.** Each nightly
  run now copies both artifacts to
  `\\uosfstore.shef.ac.uk\shared\star_group1\Shared\D1-Server-Backup\postgres`
  (5-day retention there, 14 locally), and a one-off snapshot of the 26 GB
  `directus-uploads` volume was placed alongside it — 11,330 files,
  26,250,038,491 bytes, verified byte-for-byte against the source.

  **Accepted risk, decided deliberately:** the dump sits on a group-readable
  share, so read access to `star_group1\Shared` is equivalent to read access to
  the research data, user emails and the `directus_users` bcrypt password
  hashes. The maintainer's judgement is that the share is the research group's
  own and the data is theirs too. The mitigations considered and declined were
  encrypting the artifacts to a private key, and breaking ACL inheritance on the
  backup folder. Revisit if the share's membership ever widens beyond the group.

  The real `.env` is deliberately excluded — live database and admin
  credentials on a group share would be a different category of exposure, since
  it grants write access to production rather than read access to a snapshot.
  `.env.example` is stored instead and the restore README says a rebuild needs
  the secrets from a password manager.

- **`directus-uploads` is a one-off snapshot, not synced.** Only the Postgres
  dumps refresh nightly; 26 GB over SMB every night is not sensible. Newly
  uploaded files are therefore unprotected off-host until someone re-runs the
  copy. A weekly incremental (`robocopy /MIR`) would close most of the gap.
- **`directus_revisions` bloat.** 1812 MB of the 2710 MB database — 67% — is
  Directus revision history, and it dominates both backup size and duration.
  A retention policy on revisions would shrink every future archive
  substantially. Out of scope for this ADR, but worth its own decision.
