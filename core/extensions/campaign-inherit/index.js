// Directus hook: campaign-inherit
//
// Campaigns (machining trials / testing campaigns) group children under a project
// and carry defaults. When a child is created with a campaign set, it inherits the
// campaign's project, default equipment and default material so the user doesn't
// re-enter them.
//
// It deliberately does NOT fill the owner. This hook loads before `d1-default-owner`
// (alphabetical), and every fill here is blank-only, so an owner copied from the project's
// PI or the campaign's owner would be in place before d1-default-owner ran and would beat
// "the creator becomes the owner" (ADR-0011 decision 8). Since ADR-0011 the owner is what
// lets the creator see and edit the record they just made, so the creator must always win;
// someone else owns it only when the form or API names them.
