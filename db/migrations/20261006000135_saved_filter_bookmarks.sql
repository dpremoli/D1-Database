-- D12: saved filters for the everyday "show me my ..." questions, as global Directus bookmarks
-- (directus_presets with bookmark set and "user" and role NULL, so every user sees them in the
-- collection's sidebar). The existing Machining / FAST / Samples bookmarks are untouched.

-- "Mine" resolves through the person record: owner_person_id -> people.user_id = $CURRENT_USER.
-- The legacy `owner` column (a direct Directus-user uuid, hidden since the people unification,
-- migration 062) is no longer what the owner picker writes, so it is not used.

-- seeds the same rows and its bookmark clean-up spares these names. On CI the directus_presets
-- stub starts empty, so the rows are inserted there too.
