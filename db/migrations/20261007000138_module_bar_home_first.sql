-- migrate:up
-- Explorer pages (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-explorer-pages-design.md): the Home module
-- becomes the first entry of the Directus module bar, and the Data Studio ("content") moves to
-- just after the dashboards, so a user lands on Home and reaches the formatted pages first.
-- Directus has one global module bar, so this orders it for everybody; it cannot hide the Data
-- Studio from a role (that is a non-goal of the spec).
--
-- The bar is a JSON array of {type, id, enabled}, as in 20260711000090_fast_module_bar.sql:
--   * home: moved to the front, or added (enabled) when the bar does not list it;
--   * content: moved to just after the last of the three dashboards that is listed; left where it
--     is when none is listed, and not added when the bar does not list it;
--   * everything else keeps its relative order.
-- A NULL bar (Directus' own default) is left alone. Running it twice changes nothing.

-- migrate:down
-- Undo the reordering: Home leaves the bar and the Data Studio goes back to the front, where
-- scripts/configure_directus.sql had it. For a bar that still has the shipped order this restores
-- the previous array exactly. A bar that listed Home before the up migration (curated in the UI)
-- loses that entry here; add it again under Settings > Appearance.
