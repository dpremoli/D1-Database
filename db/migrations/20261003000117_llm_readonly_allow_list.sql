-- migrate:up
-- Text-to-SQL role: back to an explicit allow-list (ADR-0009, review findings 5.8 / 6.4).
--
-- Migration 20260701000052 gave d1_llm_readonly `SELECT ON ALL TABLES` plus a default
-- privilege for every future table, minus a 12-name deny-list. That is a deny-list: it
-- left audit_logs (full row JSON of every change), people (email), Machine_Operators and,
-- on a live Directus database, directus_activity / directus_revisions / directus_notifications
-- readable by LLM-authored SQL, and every table added later was readable by default.
-- A SQL-guard bypass (see plugins/llm-text-to-sql/app/lib/sql_guard.py) therefore reached
-- all of it. Here the role loses everything and is granted exactly the lab tables and
-- views the plugin needs. A new table is invisible to the LLM until a later migration
-- grants it, and a view that is DROPped and recreated must be re-granted (CREATE OR
-- REPLACE keeps the grant).
--
-- NOT granted: audit_logs, people, Machine_Operators, archive_metadata_edits (an audit
-- trail of who corrected what), force_crawler_state (daemon control row), schema_migrations,
-- every directus_* table, v_embeddings_source_notes (the embedding backfill reads it as the
-- writer role, not as this one). semantic_embeddings IS granted: /api/search reads it
-- through this role; the SQL guard keeps LLM-authored SQL off it.
--
-- Functions: tables are the boundary. The public functions are not SECURITY DEFINER (the
-- audit trigger function returns trigger and cannot be called), so refresh_project_rollup(),
-- expand_tool_box_intake() and the generate_*() helpers run with this role's own rights and
-- fail on the first write. EXECUTE cannot be revoked from a role that inherits it through
-- PUBLIC, and the f_trace_* grants from 20260619000015 are kept.
--
-- Roles. d1_llm_readonly stays a NOLOGIN privilege bundle. This migration also creates
-- d1_llm_app, the NOLOGIN member the plugin connects as; the runbook (docs/runbooks/
-- text-to-sql.md) then only has to ALTER ROLE d1_llm_app LOGIN PASSWORD '...'. If an
-- operator already created d1_llm_app by hand it is left as it is (login and password
-- untouched) apart from membership and the read-only settings. Role-level SET values are
-- not inherited from the group, so they are set on the member too; the plugin also pins
-- read-only and a statement timeout per connection.
