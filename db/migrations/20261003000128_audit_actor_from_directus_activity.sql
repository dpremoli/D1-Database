-- migrate:up
-- Review finding 4.9: the audit actor can be lost for writes that come through the Directus API.
--
-- The actor-identity hook sets d1.actor_identity with set_config(..., true) from an items.* filter
-- hook. That is transaction-local, so it only reaches audit_trigger_function() if the hook runs on
-- the SAME transaction as the write. Directus passes `database: trx` to the create filter, but for
-- update and delete it emits the filter before it opens the write's transaction and passes its root
-- connection pool instead (not verifiable here: Directus' API source is not in the repo or in
-- node_modules; see the review report). On the pool the set_config lands in an autocommit
-- statement on some other connection and is gone before the UPDATE runs, so PATCH/DELETE through
-- the API were attributed to NULL.
--
-- Directus does, in the write's own transaction, insert a directus_activity row per item written
-- (collection, item, "user"), after the item itself. This migration uses that as a fallback that
-- does not depend on which connection the hook saw:
--   * audit_log_actors  (log_id -> actor_identity) records the actor for audit rows that carry none.
--     audit_logs itself stays untouched and append-only (its UPDATE rule still discards edits).
--   * an AFTER INSERT trigger on directus_activity attributes EVERY audit row of the same transaction
--     that has no actor yet (event_timestamp = transaction_timestamp(), which is what audit_logs
--     stamps by default) to the activity row's user. A Directus request is one transaction with one
--     actor, so this also covers rows that other triggers wrote in it and that Directus has no
--     activity row for: the children of a box intake (migration 125), the cascade of an owner change
--     (124), the prep_steps copied from a recipe (129). Matching on (collection, item) would have
--     missed them. A GUC-supplied actor always wins: only rows with actor_identity IS NULL are
--     attributed, and the first attribution of a row stands (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING). Audit rows
--     written after the activity row, in the same transaction, are not covered.
--   * v_audit_logs_with_actor is audit_logs with actor_identity = COALESCE(logged actor, recorded
--     actor). Readers that want "who did this" should use it.
-- audit_log_actors is part of the audit mechanism itself, like audit_logs: it carries no OCC or
-- audit trigger of its own.
-- Writes that bypass Directus (plugins, scripts, psql) are unaffected: they still set
-- d1.actor_identity themselves (docs/api-contract.md section 8.4).
--
-- The trigger is created only when directus_activity exists: it is a Directus-managed table, and on
-- CI's bare Postgres it is not one of the stubs. It is created inside an exception guard so that a
-- deployment where the migration user does not own the table still migrates; the NOTICE says so.
-- If Directus ever drops and recreates directus_activity (a major upgrade), re-run the CREATE TRIGGER
-- below. The index on audit_logs (table_name, record_id) serves the trigger's lookup and the
-- common "history of this record" query; it takes a brief write lock while it builds.
