"""Decide what a force-app-release.yml run does, check the release is consistent, and write the
release notes. Runs in the workflow's first job; no build happens unless this says so.

What ships is always apps/force-app/desktop/package.json's version, as tag force-app-v<version>.
A version is "released" once a GitHub Release exists for that tag (d1-server's auto-publish task
polls Releases, not tags). So:

  push to main          release the version if it has no GitHub Release yet, else do nothing.
                        Merging a version bump ships it; a failed release is retried by the
                        next push to main, or by the button.
  workflow_dispatch     the button. Releases main's version if it has no Release; dry_run builds
                        and tests without publishing (any branch).
  pull_request          a dry run (build + every test, never publish) on PRs that change the
                        version or the packaging (pr_packaging_changes). Other PRs that start the
                        workflow (a lockfile bump) only get the consistency checks: a Windows build
                        bills about 36 minutes, and ci.yml tests the rest on Linux. Fails early if
                        the version would ship without its changelog entry.
  push of a tag         a hand-pushed force-app-v* tag, as before. It must match package.json.

Usage (CI): release_plan.py --notes <path>    env: EVENT, REF, SHA, DRY_RUN, REPO, GH_TOKEN
