"""Decide what a force-app-release.yml run does, check the release is consistent, and write the
release notes. Runs in the workflow's first job; no build happens unless this says so.

What ships is always apps/force-app/desktop/package.json's version, as tag force-app-v<version>.
A version is "released" once a GitHub Release exists for that tag (d1-server's auto-publish task
polls Releases, not tags). So:

  push to main          release the version if it has no GitHub Release yet, else do nothing.
                        Merging a version bump ships it; a failed release is retried by the
                        next push to main, or by the button.
  workflow_dispatch     the button. Releases main's version if it has no Release; dry_run builds
                        and tests without publishing (any branch).
  pull_request          a dry run (build + every test, never publish) on PRs that change the
                        version or the packaging. Fails early if the version would ship without
                        its changelog entry.
  push of a tag         a hand-pushed force-app-v* tag, as before. It must match package.json.
