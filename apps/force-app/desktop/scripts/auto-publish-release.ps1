# Polls GitHub for the latest published force-app-v* release and publishes it to the
# Caddy-served update feed the moment a new one appears -- automates what publish-release.ps1
# used to require a human to run by hand after every CI build. Same pull-based trust model as
# that script (this machine has outbound internet and its own `gh auth login`; no
# tailnet-reaching credential is added to GitHub Actions -- see publish-release.ps1's header).
#
# Meant to run every few minutes via a Windows Scheduled Task -- see
# install-auto-publish-task.ps1, which registers exactly that. Safe to run concurrently or
# on a tight schedule: it only acts when the latest release's tag differs from the one
# recorded in the marker file, and publish-release.ps1's own `gh release download --clobber`
# is idempotent for a re-publish of the same tag.
#
# Requires: `gh auth login` has been run once on this machine (same precondition as
# publish-release.ps1, which this script calls).
#
# Manual run (normally invoked by the scheduled task, not by hand):
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\auto-publish-release.ps1
