"""Finalize a capture: stream the raw file in constant memory, sum + gain the dyno channels,
derive RPM + cumulative revs + cut window, and write the deliverables — a .mat (v1.0 layout), a
live_cache.bin (D1LC, so the plotting UI renders it directly), and summary.json.

The .mat DATA layout is [Time, Fx1,Fx2,Fy1,Fy2,Fz1,Fz2,Fz3,Fz4, Tacho] (v1.0), identical to what
the MATLAB app writes, so downstream tooling (process_force.m, the Directus crawler) is unchanged
— any configured extra (Aux/virtual) channels are strictly APPENDED after these 10, never inserted
among them, so a capture with none configured (which includes every capture recorded before extra
channels existed) still produces the exact original layout.

live_cache.bin (D1LC) does NOT get extra channels: that format is byte-identical across this app,
plugins/filter-service, and scripts/matlab/process_force.m — extending it needs coordinated changes
across all three, which is out of scope here. A virtual/Aux channel is archived in capture.mat and
streamed live (see session.py), but not shown if a finished capture is reopened in the Plot page.

Constant memory (#79): nothing here is ever full-length. A 12430 s capture (310M samples, 12 GB
of raw) used to die allocating its first float64 copy; now the raw file is read in BLOCK_ROWS
blocks over a few passes — whole-capture statistics first (gains, peaks, the drift-compensation
fit, the tacho's range), then the corrected |Fz| peak if drift_comp moved it, then the cut window,
then one pass that derives RPM/revs and fills the live cache, the cut-window diagnostics and the
.mat. Peak memory is a few blocks' worth however long the capture ran. The only full-length array
left is the .mat's DATA, which only exists under MAT_MAX_BYTES.
