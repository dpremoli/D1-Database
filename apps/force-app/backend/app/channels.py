"""The arbitrary channel model: named channels with a role, optionally bound to a physical NI-DAQ
input. Roles drive the force maths (all ``Fx`` channels sum into Fx, etc.); ``Tacho`` marks the
speed input; ``Index`` marks a zero-count/tooth-identity pulse (opt-in only -- see the module
docstring note below); ``Aux`` is recorded but not summed. ``source="virtual"`` channels have no
physical binding yet (bindable later).

Two dyno presets:
  - DYNO_STATIONARY ("stationary_8"): today's 4-component plate, Fx1/Fx2/Fy1/Fy2/Fz1..Fz4 summed
    in pairs/quads into Fx/Fy/Fz. Bridges to the recorder's fixed
    [Fx1,Fx2,Fy1,Fy2,Fz1,Fz2,Fz3,Fz4,Tacho] layout.
  - DYNO_ROTATING ("rotating_4"): a rotating cutting-force dynamometer (e.g. Kistler RCD 9170B /
    9123C) -- four SINGLE components Fx, Fy, Fz, Mz, no paired corners to sum. This preset can be
    authored and persisted, but `to_record_channels` refuses to start a recording with it: the
    fixed 9-column layout has no slot for a lone Fx or for Mz. That needs the v2 variable-column
    recorder (see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-27-force-capture-v2-schema-design.md), which is
    a separate, larger piece of work -- see
    docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-07-milling-path-models-and-polar-design.md #5.

``Index`` is never auto-assigned: it needs >=4 kHz sampling against the standard force channels'
~1 kHz anti-aliasing filter (Kistler 9123C manual, chapter 5.8), so binding it is an explicit,
opt-in user action, not something autoassign should guess at.
