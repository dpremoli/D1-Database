"""Host / Origin guard for the recorder API (review 1.7).

The recorder has no authentication: its only protection is that it listens on loopback. A web page
the operator merely visits can still reach it from their browser, in two ways:

* a cross-site `fetch(..., {mode: "no-cors"})` POST (to /record/stop, or /record/start and
  /storage/config with a body that needs no CORS preflight) — the response is opaque but the
  request is sent and acted on;
* a WebSocket handshake to /record/stream (WebSockets are not subject to CORS at all);
* DNS rebinding, where an attacker's hostname resolves to 127.0.0.1 so that "cross-site" becomes
  same-origin from the browser's point of view.

Every browser attaches an `Origin` header to those requests (and to WebSocket handshakes) and
always sends the page's own hostname as `Host`, so this pure-ASGI middleware refuses:

* any HTTP or WebSocket request whose `Host` is not a loopback name (or an explicitly configured
  extra host) on the port the server is listening on, and
* any request carrying an `Origin` that is not on the allow-list (the CORS list, the desktop
  renderer's `app://force`).

Requests with NO `Origin` (curl, the Electron main process, the sidecar health probe, the
installer's smoke tests) are not browser cross-site requests and keep working.
