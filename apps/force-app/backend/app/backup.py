"""Non-blocking live-backup streamer: tails the raw.d1raw file during recording and POSTs chunks
to the remote backup server. Runs in a daemon thread — never delays or blocks the local recording.

Design goals (from the spec):
  - Never delay local recording because of networking.
  - Continue local recording if network fails.
  - Automatically resume backup if network reconnects.
  - Chunk-based streaming (every ~5 seconds) for resilience.
