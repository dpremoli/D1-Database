"""FastAPI app for the local recording backend (slice 2a).

Single-session model (one acquisition rig per host): /record/start creates a session, /record/stop
finalizes it, WS /record/stream broadcasts D1LF live frames, and /captures/* serves the finished
artifacts (so the plotting UI can render the just-recorded live_cache.bin). CORS mirrors the
filter-service so the standalone SPA can reach it from its own origin.
