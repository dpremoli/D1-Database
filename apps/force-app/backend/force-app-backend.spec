# PyInstaller spec for the frozen recorder backend. One-folder mode (not --onefile): a one-file
# build re-extracts ~200 MB of scipy/numpy to a temp dir on every launch, which is slow and a
# reliable antivirus trigger — see
# docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-10-force-app-desktop-packaging-design.md.

# Build with: pyinstaller force-app-backend.spec --noconfirm

# h5py writes the MATLAB v7.3 .mat for long cuts (app/mat73.py, #194). It is imported lazily,
# inside Mat73Writer.__init__, so a broken h5py/HDF5 install cannot stop the backend starting; the
# static trace may therefore miss it, and its compiled extensions (h5py.defs,
# h5py._conv, ... ) are loaded by name and h5py ships HDF5 itself as a bundled library (hdf5.dll
# and friends on Windows, h5py.libs/ elsewhere): collect both explicitly rather than rely on the
# static trace, because a frozen build that lacks them only loses the .mat of a >1.5 GB cut (finalize
# records why in summary.json's mat_skip_reason) instead of failing at startup.

# nidaqmx is only installed where the acquisition extra is (`pip install -e ".[nidaq]"`); don't
# force it as a hidden import on a build machine that doesn't have it.
#
# Collect the whole package, not just the top-level module: app/sources/nidaq.py's
# _import_nidaqmx() imports nidaqmx.constants and nidaqmx.stream_readers lazily inside a function,
# which PyInstaller's static analysis cannot trace, and nidaqmx ships data files of its own. A
# bare hidden import of "nidaqmx" froze an exe whose nidaq_available() returned False while the
# same venv's unfrozen backend returned True.
#
# Note collect_data_files/copy_metadata return (src, dest) tuples: those belong in
# Analysis(datas=...), not in hiddenimports, which takes module-name strings only.
#
# copy_metadata(..., recursive=True) is load-bearing, not belt-and-braces. nidaqmx pulls in
# nitypes, which calls importlib.metadata.version("nitypes") at import time; PyInstaller does not
# bundle .dist-info by default, so without this the frozen exe fails with
# "NI-DAQmx not available: No package metadata was found for nitypes" and nidaq_available() is
# False even though the same venv's unfrozen backend returns True. Recursive picks up nidaqmx's
# whole dependency chain (nitypes, hightime, ...) rather than guessing at names.
