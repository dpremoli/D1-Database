// Video-style playback of an archived cut. The playhead lives here, in the browser, and fills the

// it renders a live recording, with no panel changes at all.
//
// Nothing is written to disk and no RecordingSession is opened: playback is a viewer, not a
// recording. That is also what makes scrubbing possible — RawWriter is append-only and
// FrmIntegrator carries theta/rho across chunks, so seeking backwards through a real session
// would either corrupt the capture or need integrator state unwound that was never built to unwind.
//
// DETERMINISM: a sample's envelope bin and its FRM point are pure functions of its INDEX, never of
// when it was drawn. That is the whole trick — it makes "seek to t" and "play through to t"
// produce byte-identical buffers, which is the invariant engine.test.ts pins down.
