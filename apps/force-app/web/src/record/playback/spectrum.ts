// bit-identical to a live one's rather than a second implementation that could drift.
//
// Two behaviours make a few-per-second call affordable while scrubbing:
//   throttle  — at most one call per minIntervalMs (300 by default, matching the backend's own
//               live-FFT throttle in session._update_fft)
//   coalesce  — while a call is in flight only the NEWEST pending request survives, so dragging
//               the scrub bar can never build a queue of stale windows to work through.
