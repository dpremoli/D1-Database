//     structured detail ({field, max, min, message}), so the form can point at the field itself.
//   - The session fails after it started. The backend says which stage failed (`error_kind`):
//     "start" (no sample was ever captured, so nothing was kept), "acquisition" (failed mid-run,
//     what was captured was finalized) or "finalize" (the outputs couldn't be written, the raw is
//     still on disk for recovery). The raw driver text is kept for a "Details" disclosure but is
//     never the headline: "DaqError: … DAQmx_SampClk_Rate … Status Code: -200077" says nothing
//     to someone who just wants to record.
