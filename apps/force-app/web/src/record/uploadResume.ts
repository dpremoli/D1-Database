// Resumable upload of one capture (stream-2 review 2.2). The save is three steps: the
// manufacturing_operations row, the capture's files (/files), then the machining_force_analysis
// row. A failure in step 2 or 3 used to be retried from step 1, inserting a second operation row
// and uploading the files again. Each step now records what it finished, keyed by capture id, so a
// retry (from the save dialog or from Settings > Local Captures) continues where it stopped.
//
// A response can also be lost after the server committed (a timeout), so before inserting again
// the operation is looked up by the capture id both upload paths stamp into
// recorded_metadata.capture_id. Directus cannot filter on a key inside that JSON field
// (captureUploadState.ts), so candidate rows are fetched by created_at and matched here.
