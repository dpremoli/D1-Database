// Both upload paths (workspace.ts's end-of-cut save and uploadCapture.ts's retry) stamp the
// capture id into manufacturing_operations.recorded_metadata.capture_id. That is a key inside a
// JSON field, and Directus cannot filter on one: it rejects `recorded_metadata.capture_id` as an
// unknown field (403), even for an administrator. So the candidate rows are fetched and matched
// here instead. The fetch is bounded by created_at, because a row is always created after its
// capture was recorded and a capture id starts with its recording time.
//
// A matching operation row alone does NOT mean "uploaded". The upload order is operation row ->
// files -> analysis row (record/uploadCapture.ts), so an upload that died after the first step
// leaves an orphan operation row and nothing else. "Uploaded" (the state that lets Free up space
// and bulk delete treat the local copy as redundant) therefore also needs a
// machining_force_analysis row for that operation with its live cache file set, plus the .mat
// file when the capture wrote one. An operation row without those is a partial upload: the
// capture stays uploadable (ensureOperation resumes on the existing row) and counts as the only copy.
