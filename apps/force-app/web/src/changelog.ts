			'The Record page keeps up with the recorder: a cut that finished while you were on another page now offers to save when you come back, and after a backend restart the page reconnects on its own and points you to Recover for an interrupted cut.',
			'Saving a cut to the database after a failed attempt resumes where it stopped instead of creating a second run record.',
			'Pop-out windows follow the main window when it catches up with the recorder, and the Lab Amp is reset once a long save finishes. The banner says "Saving" while a cut is being saved.',
			'Quitting or updating while a recording is still being saved now warns you first, instead of cutting the save short.',
			'Fixed: a recording could hang for good if writing its data failed (for example a full disk); it now stops with the error and keeps what was captured. A virtual-channel formula that would fail during a recording is refused when you save it.',
			'NI-DAQ channel, card and tacho settings are locked while a recording runs or is being saved.',
			'Security: the recorder only answers this PC and the app itself, so a web page you visit can no longer start, stop or delete recordings or read the live data.',
			'Plot page: a filter bake or point-cloud build that finishes after you switch operation no longer lands on the wrong operation, hovering a zoomed chart marks the right sample, the FRM views come back correctly after visiting another page, and polar plots handle negative values.',
			'Settings > Connectivity: Save keeps only what you changed, and Reset returns to the app\'s own settings.',
			'Replays of cuts longer than ten minutes work, and the live backup keeps its data if a session is registered twice.',
			'Plot page: right-click a point on the FRM map to show when it happened on the force charts (and to set the crop there); hovering or right-clicking the charts shows the spot on the map, in the Lite and Full views.',

		version: '0.1.33',
		date: '2026-10-03',
		notes: [
			'Long recordings no longer run out of memory when they are saved: the end-of-cut processing now reads the capture in blocks, so a multi-hour capture saves in a few hundred MB. Time stamps are now exact for long captures.',
			'Fixed: the recorder could freeze silently after a few hundred requests. The app now also notices a backend that stops answering and restarts it, and offers to reload a window that crashes or hangs.',
			'Choose any folder for local recordings (Settings > General). Local Captures shows each capture\'s folder, with "Show in folder" and a copy button.',
			'Pop-out windows that were open when you quit reopen at the next start. Closing the main window now quits the app, because the pop-outs depend on it.',
			'Connectivity Doctor: "crashed recordings" no longer deletes anything without asking. It lists each recording with its size and whether a backup exists, and says so while discarding is still in progress.',
			'Local Captures: incomplete recordings have a Recover button, are named from their recording settings, and show when a remote backup exists.',
			'Live Backup: the list of remote backups loads when you open the tab and says what each one is (fully backed up, partial, or deleted locally and when it expires). Retention is set on the backup server and shown read-only.',
			'Restoring a backup never overwrites a local recording that holds data, and a download that is cut off is detected instead of being treated as complete.',
			'A sample rate the NI-DAQ hardware cannot do is caught before recording starts, and the setting is highlighted. A failure to start is reported separately from a failure to save. NI-DAQ is greyed out when no hardware is connected.',
			'Replay starts at the first sample of the cut, and the timeline shows cut and force-peak markers you can click to jump to.',
			'Each force plot panel has its own time window, saved with the layout. Record plot options are remembered, and the bottom panel defaults to Tacho.',
			'Fixed: the Tacho panel was empty once a cut finished and a flat line in replay. It now draws the cut\'s RPM in both, and says "No tacho signal in this recording" when the file has none.',
			'Fixed: the live FRM map lost points after zooming or scrubbing, and the colour-scale histogram disappeared after scrubbing backwards. Pop-out windows no longer slow replay down.',
			'The RPM gauge keeps a stable scale instead of jumping with every reading.',
			'Plot page: switching force files no longer flashes or distorts the charts or shows the previous file\'s point cloud, switching Figure, Lite or Full shows loading progress, and dragging the crop handles on the end-of-cut plot is smooth.',
			'Colour scale: unticking "symmetrical" or "always show zero" restores the original range, and the handles no longer get stuck.',
			'Settings is a fixed-height page that scrolls inside itself, and links from hints and the Doctor open the right tab and highlight the setting.',
			'The LabAmp and NI-DAQ pages show their last-known data at once while they refresh. Lookup lists mark the current and already-picked items.',
			'Bug reports: pick several areas, the reported-issues list is kept between visits, and a new report appears in it immediately.',
			'Lists in the database (samples, operations, tools and others) sort codes naturally, so F9 comes before F10.',

			'Sign in with no connection. An account that has signed in on this PC before can sign in offline with the same password (kept only as a salted hash, for 30 days after its last online sign-in). A banner marks an offline session; "Sign in to sync" upgrades it once you are connected.',
			'Every recording now carries who recorded it and when. A capture recorded offline and uploaded later, even by someone else, keeps its original owner and recording time; the database also notes who uploaded it.',
			'Queued run records upload automatically only under the account that recorded them. Another user can upload them deliberately with "Upload as me" in Settings > Local Captures.',
			'The Sample, Operator, Machine, Tool, Insert and Edge pickers work offline from a copy refreshed while connected (Settings > Connectivity shows its age and has "Refresh now").',
			'Fixed: a dropped connection while refreshing the session signed you out. Only a refusal from the server does that now.',
			'Fixed: editing a capture\'s metadata no longer drops who recorded it.',

		version: '0.1.31',
		date: '2026-09-27',
		notes: [
			'Icons now show on a PC with no internet connection. They used to appear as their names (e.g. "fiber_manual_record Start") because the icon font was downloaded on every start.',
			'Fixed: the live FFT and Power plots stayed blank until a channel chip was clicked, and the spectrogram and waterfall stuck to the first channel picked.',
			'Each plot panel\'s title is now its plot-type picker: point at "FFT ›" to switch between Time, FFT, Power, Spectrogram and Waterfall. The same applies in the pop-out window and the Plot page.',
			'The FRM map has a colour-scale editor with a legend: colormap, steps, display and saturation ranges, with a histogram of the values behind the colour bar.',
			'Virtual channels: build computed channels from a formula on the NI-DAQ page, and add extra hardware (Aux) channels.',
			'Clearer text and controls: one set of text sizes with nothing smaller than 11px, one button style across the app, and one accent colour (amber in dark mode, slate in light mode).',
			'Light mode reworked: plot traces, legends, status colours and the login card are now easy to read on the light background.',
			'Removed duplicated controls and readouts: the separate "Recording behaviour" block (the toggles next to Start do the same), the RPM tile in Overview, the storage block on the Connectivity page, and the Plot page\'s show/hide eye buttons.',
			'Number tiles keep their unit next to the value and no longer cut values off in a narrow panel.',
			'Resetting the panel layout now asks first.',
			'Keyboard: the navigation sidebar opens with Enter and closes with Escape, lookup lists can be moved through with the arrow keys, and every dialog keeps focus inside it and closes with Escape.',
			'Animations are consistent, and are turned off when Windows\' "Show animations" setting is off.',
			'Fixed: Local Captures could never tell which captures were already uploaded, so the Upload buttons never appeared.',
			'Fixed: editing the metadata of an uploaded capture failed to load its record.',
			'Connectivity Doctor hints now point to the right place for each fix.',

		version: '0.1.30',
		date: '2026-09-24',
		notes: [
			'Fixed: replaying a file broke as soon as you left the Recording window and came back — the transport still looked active but play, pause and scrubbing all did nothing. Replay now keeps its place and resumes properly.',
			'Fixed: after leaving and returning to the Recording window during replay, only the time-series plot still worked — FFT, Power, Spectrogram and Waterfall stayed blank for the rest of the session.',
			'The FRM map can now be panned (drag) and zoomed (scroll wheel) instead of being locked to an automatic fit, with a "Reset view" button to return to the automatic framing.',
			'Fixed: changing the colormap during replay only recoloured newly-drawn points, leaving the rest of the spiral on the old colormap until you navigated away and back. The whole map now repaints immediately.',
			'Fixed: the Recording window always had a small scrollbar in its default layout, even with nothing to scroll to.',
			'The Recording panel has been reorganised: Machine and Operator now have their own subpanel, and the recording toggles sit next to Start.',
			'Fixed: captures too large to export as .mat no longer fail their whole upload — the "Save a local copy (.mat)" option is now correctly unavailable for them, with an explanation, instead of silently downloading nothing.',
			'Fixed: the Plot window leaked graphics resources each time you navigated away and back, which could leave the point cloud unable to recover on large operations.',
			'Bug reports no longer include your Windows account name in the attached diagnostics.',

			'F11 now toggles fullscreen.',

			'Settings > About: a link to the full GitHub releases page, and the changelog list now scrolls within its own area instead of growing the whole window taller.',
			'The recording-in-progress banner shown on other pages now says "Go to Recording".',
			'The incomplete-recordings banner gained an "Ignore for now" option, for when you want to deal with a crashed recording later instead of recovering or discarding it immediately.',

			'Recording Settings: the Sample Rate field now warns immediately if the configured rate exceeds what the assigned NI-DAQ hardware can actually deliver, instead of only failing once a recording is started.',
			'Lab Amp > Auto-range: "Recommend from peaks" can now use several previous recordings at once (not just the last one picked) — the recommendation uses each channel\'s largest peak across all of them.',
			'Fixed: the Plot dashboard\'s FRM panel could briefly claim the Signals column\'s space too when returning to the page from elsewhere, before snapping back to the correct layout a moment later.',
			'Fixed: the Logs view\'s timestamp column could overlap the level tag next to it; timestamps are now genuinely UTC (previously shown unlabeled machine-local time).',
		],

	{
		version: '0.1.27',
		date: '2026-09-16',
		notes: [
			'Fixed: navigating away from the Record page and back during a live cut could silently reset the plotted history and buffers, as if the recording had just started, even though the recording itself never stopped.',
			'Fixed: the disk-space-warning and incomplete-recordings banners pushed the whole recording layout down while shown, then left it squeezed into the smaller space after being dismissed — both now overlay the page instead of shifting it.',
			'Fixed: the cross-page "recording in progress" banner\'s elapsed-time counter only advanced once every 5 seconds instead of ticking live.',
			'Fixed: the Spectrogram and Waterfall views let you tick multiple channels even though only the first ever rendered — selecting a channel in either view now replaces the selection instead of silently no-oping.',
		],

		version: '0.1.26',
		date: '2026-09-16',
		notes: [
			'Fixed: the live bandwidth readout on the Record page could flicker constantly between e.g. "1 MB/s" and "1000 KB/s".',
			'Fixed: the report-a-bug/feature form could lose whatever you\'d already typed if you switched Settings tabs or popped the window before submitting.',
			'Fixed: discarding an incomplete recording said this "cannot be undone" even when a remote backup copy still existed — the dialog now says so and points you to Settings > Remote Live Backup when that\'s the case.',
			'Renamed the Force panel\'s time-domain tab from "Force" to "Time" — the channels shown there aren\'t always force (e.g. Tacho, or a milling recording\'s torque/position channels).',
		],

		version: '0.1.25',
		date: '2026-09-16',

			'Fixed: the Lab Amp could be left in MEASURE mode indefinitely after a crashed recording was recovered or discarded, instead of resetting like a normal end-of-cut.',
			'Fixed: the "Reset view" button on the Record page could stop working after a banner (disk warning, incomplete recordings) was dismissed — the layout stayed squeezed into the smaller space even though more room was now available.',

		version: '0.1.24',
		date: '2026-09-16',

			'Fixed: recording a very large capture could crash the whole app during finalize (an internal file-format limit on the archived .mat file). Oversized captures now finalize successfully — the plot data and summary are still produced and saved, just without a full-resolution .mat archive.',
			'Fixed: a recording that was still actively streaming could appear in the "incomplete recordings" recovery list with a Restore option, as if it had crashed.',
			'Fixed: changing the Lab Amp\'s mode, ranges, or calibration is now blocked while a recording is in progress, instead of being able to corrupt the live capture.',
			'Fixed: the safety alarm banner could show a nonsensical "0.0 N" for the tacho/RPM signal-integrity alarm, reading as a misbehaving force alarm even when force alarms were turned off.',

		version: '0.1.23',

			'Report a bug/feature page: reports now carry an Area tag (Recording, Plotting, Diagnostics, Settings, Lab Amp, NI-DAQ, GUI, General), pre-selected from whichever page you were on before opening the report form.',

			'New Metadata Doctor (Plot dashboard): flags operations where the archived .mat file\'s recorded parameters disagree with, or are missing from, the database — undersized crop windows, conflicting feed/depth-of-cut/speed/diameter, unlinked samples — with one-click fixes that route through the existing "Save changes" dialog. A severity badge and filter show flagged ops directly in the Operations list; a workpiece diameter field was added to the metadata box so it has somewhere to adopt into.',
			'Fixed: the operation code and sequence fields in the Plot dashboard\'s metadata box looked editable but any edits were silently discarded — both are now shown as the fixed, non-editable values they always actually were.',
			'End-of-cut save dialog: the detected cut start/end can now be dragged to adjust before saving, with a note and one-click reset if you want to revert to the auto-detected window.',
			'Report a bug/feature page: you can now tag whether you\'re filing a bug or a feature request, your signed-in email is always attached to the report, and the page shows your recently-filed reports with their open/closed status.',
			'Fixed: leaving the Plot page and coming back reloaded it from scratch every time, including re-fetching the drive list on every visit to Settings > General.',
			'Fixed: discarding a just-finished recording (instead of saving it) could leave its plot data showing on the next recording.',
			'Fixed: the Signals/FRM column on the Plot page could fall slightly short of matching the record window\'s exact height.',
			'Fixed: the FRM point cloud in Lite mode could vanish when zoomed in, not reappearing until you zoomed back out.',
			'Fixed: a Full-res (Potree) point cloud kept showing the old crop window after the crop was adjusted and saved — it\'s now automatically rebuilt on the next save.',

			'Plot dashboard: dragging the FRM point-cloud crop handles is now instant even on multi-million-point cuts (previously visibly laggy) — the crop preview moved onto the GPU instead of being recomputed on every drag frame.',
			'Plot dashboard: the mouse cursor no longer lags when scrubbing across multiple open charts at once.',
			'Fixed: a saved crop override stopped being applied once you left Live mode, silently reverting to the auto-detected crop window.',
			'Plot dashboard: dark mode grid lines and axis ticks are now dim instead of bright white, and axis text is larger and easier to read.',
			'Plot dashboard: an optional second axis showing the tool\'s radial position (distance from the part centre) can now be added to the Signals charts.',
			'Plot dashboard: Power, Spectrogram, and Waterfall views now have the same per-axis layout, axis labels, hover readout, and zoom/pan as Force/FFT (previously collapsed multi-axis panels to a single axis and had no interactive axes at all).',
			'Plot dashboard: editing an operation\'s metadata (subtype, sequence, cutting parameters, notes) and adjusting its crop now save together in one combined "Save changes" summary, including a preview of the regenerated operation name.',

			'New Polar Plot panel (Record page → Add panel, with its own pop-out window): plots torque or force against spindle angle for a finished or replayed cut — the milling counterpart to the FRM map.',
			'Fixed: the FRM map could come up blank, or show a "no host installed" error, immediately after a recording finished — unless you had opened the Plot page earlier in the same session.',
			'Diagnostics Workbench: a very long or high-speed cut, a straight-line cut, or a recipe with the frame-transform step switched off no longer crashes the analysis bake — each now fails with a clear reason.',
			'Diagnostics Workbench: the framed-view recompute now returns a readable error (not a bare server error) when a crop is too large or a seed layer is missing; clicking a pipeline step to revert the view now redirects the view you are actually looking at and clears its stale colouring.',
			'Force capture files can now carry torque (Mz) and machine tool-position (X/Y/Z) channels alongside force, as groundwork for milling support. Older capture files load unchanged.',

			'The "recording in progress" banner shown when you navigate away from Record is now blue with live elapsed time, sample count, and peak force, instead of looking like a red error banner.',
			'Disabling a safety alarm in Settings, or silencing one that has tripped, now explains exactly what you are turning off and asks you to confirm.',
			'Quitting the app while a recording is in progress now warns you and lets you cancel, instead of silently stopping the acquisition.',
			'Fixed: a healthy tacho sensor could trigger a false "No tacho signal" alarm in the first couple of seconds of every real recording.',
			'Fixed: acknowledging one safety alarm could silently silence a different alarm that fired at the same moment, without ever showing it to you.',
			'Bug reports can now include more diagnostic detail (amp mode, NI-DAQ hardware, disk space, more log history, and this window\'s console) to make problems easier to diagnose remotely.',

			'Recording panel: Insert/Edge and Machine/Operator fields are now side by side to save vertical space; picking an Edge auto-fills its parent Insert.',
			'The Tool field now shows the tool\'s name instead of its code.',
			'Record page panels can now extend further down the window, and the floating add-panel/reset-layout buttons are slightly larger and fade to translucent until hovered.',
