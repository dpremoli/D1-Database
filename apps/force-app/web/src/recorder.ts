// Who recorded a cut. A recording can sit on this PC for days -- recorded offline, uploaded later,
// possibly while someone else is signed in -- and Directus attributes a write to whoever's token
// performs it. So the recording user is written INTO the capture itself (extra_metadata ->
// summary.json) when the cut starts, and every upload path reads it back from there rather than
// from whoever happens to be signed in at upload time:
//   - owner_person_id on the operation is the recorder's person, not the uploader's;
//   - recorded_metadata carries recorded_by_* so the provenance survives in the database.
// (audit_logs.actor_identity still names the account that performed the write -- that is the
// truthful "who uploaded" -- and recorded_metadata.synced_by_* repeats it beside the recorder.)
