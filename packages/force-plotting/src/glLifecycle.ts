// Keep-alive lifecycle for a component that owns a WebGL context (FrmCloud, FrmOctree).
//
// ForceDashboard's Plot route is kept alive (#24/#57): leaving /plot fires onDeactivated, NOT
// onBeforeUnmount, on every nested component. A viewer that only cleaned up on unmount would keep
// its render loop, GPU buffers and context alive for the rest of the session. So deactivate tears
// down like an unmount, and activate starts again on a FRESH canvas: teardown force-loses the GL
// context (to release it), and getContext() on the same canvas never hands a lost context back, so
// a new renderer there would report "WebGL unavailable".
//
//   teardown()    release everything GPU-side and stop every loop/timer/in-flight load
//   replaceCanvas() give the template a new <canvas> (bump its :key)
//   start()       set up the renderer and (re)load; called after the new canvas is in the DOM
